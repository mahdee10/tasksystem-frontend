Welcome to the frontend of the Task Manager, a fully responsive web application that allows users to create, update, delete, and view tasks and events — all while staying synced with the backend and authenticated securely.

- 💡 Real-time status indicators and feedback messages.
- 📱 Fully responsive design for all screen sizes.
